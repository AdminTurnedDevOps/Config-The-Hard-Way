You may be in one of the following type of environments:
- You're managing an internal app
- Users internally are using the app
- You're managing multiple apps
- You're managing an app for multiple customers
- You're managing configuration data (parameters, secrets, API keys, etc.) for internal apps
- You're managing configuration data (parameters, secrets, API keys, etc.) for internal apps that customers are interacting with

In any case, or if your scenario wasn't listed above, you always have to manage configuration data. Configuration data can come in several forms including:
- Secrets
- Passwords
- API keys
- Parameters
- Environment variables
- Environment files (`.env` files)

When you have a bunch of different configuration data, especially for hybrid-cloud or multi-cloud environments, it can get extremely cumbersome to manage.
