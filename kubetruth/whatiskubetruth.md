The CloudTruth integration for kubernetes that pushes parameter updates into kubernetes resources - usually ConfigMaps and Secrets, but any resource is allowed. The goal is to provide you a mechanism that is as hands off as possible, using naming conventions to automate the delivery of configuration so that you don't have to jump through setup hoops for each app/service/etc that you would like to configure with CloudTruth.
